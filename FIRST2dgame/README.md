Welcome to my project!

This was my process of learning the syntax and basics of Java through creating a 2D game.

1. The res folder contains cosmetic things such as player designs, map.txt (how the map is displayed), and tiles (the design of trees and stuff).
2. The src folder contains the program code.
3. JAVA NOTES are some of the notes I took to look over on other days because I had to research them more.

Any folders other than these are pretty much useless.

the game is not very good don't waste your time on it!
