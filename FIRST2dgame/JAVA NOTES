These are my personal Notes I took:
REFER TO README.md FOR SCREENSHOTS AND INFO

JAVA NOTES

* Try and Catch are used to:
            Try: The action
            Catch: How to handle in the case of an error - Displaying a message, performing an action, etc.

* ImageIO - Reading files

* JAVA IS OBJECT ORIENTED.

* Main in this case is used to display the window, and run another part of the program, which later uses more parts of the program

* == means you are comparing values, "if this equals that". where, = means you are assigning

*  && is the AND operator, || is the OR operator.

* Switch operator may be used instead of many IF statements

* Note to self: never try make a character again.
